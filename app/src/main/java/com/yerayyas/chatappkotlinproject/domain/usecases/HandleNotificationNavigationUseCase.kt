 * 2.  Determining whether the app is already running or being launched fresh.
 * 3.  Orchestrating the navigation to the correct chat screen, either immediately or after a delay
 *     to allow the splash screen to display.

     * - It checks if the navigation is an initial deep-link and skips if so (as it's handled elsewhere).
     * - If `skipSplash` is true, it navigates directly to the chat screen.
     * - If `skipSplash` is false, it launches a coroutine to wait for a short period, allowing the splash
     *   screen to be seen, and then navigates.

     * @param state The [NotificationNavigationState] containing the details of the destination.
